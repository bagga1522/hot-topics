    <p>Most economists are in agree­ment that the inflation in the United States during the past three years has been the worst since the early 1940′s, taking ac­count of both severity and dura­tion. But they cannot agree on the nature of the inflation that is en­gulfing the American economy. To some, inflation denotes a spectac­ular rise in consumer prices; to others, an excessive aggregate de­mand; and to at least one econo­mist, it is the creation of new money by our monetary author­ities.

        This disagreement among econ­omists is more than an academic difference on the meaning of a popular term. It reflects profes­sional confusion as to the cause of the inflation problem and the pol­icies that might help to correct it. A review of some basic prin­ciples of economics that are ap­plicable to money may shed light on the problem.
        
        Two basic questions need to be answered: (1) What are the fac­tors that originally afforded value to money, and (2) What are the factors that effect changes in the “objective exchange value of mon­ey” or its purchasing power?
        
        Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. Wherever people pro­gressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most market­able goods as media of exchange. In primitive societies they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early civilizations where the division of labor extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as the most marketable good and finally as the only medi­um of exchange, called money. It is obvious that the chieftains, kings, and heads of state did not invent the use of money. But they frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue from currency debasement.
        
        When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later ex­changes, the demand for it obvi­ously increases. We may then speak of two partial demands which combine to raise its value in exchange—its purchasing pow­er.

    <p>Scientists first discovered in 1946 that DNA can be transferred between organisms (Clive 2011). It is now known that there are several mechanisms for DNA transfer and that these occur in nature on a large scale, for example, it is a major mechanism for antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. The first genetically modified (GM) plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in the early 1990s with the introduction of virus resistant tobacco. In 1994, the transgenic ‘Flavour Saver tomato’ was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the USA. The modification allowed the tomato to delay ripening after picking. In 1995, few transgenic crops received marketing approval. This include canola with modified oil composition (Calgene), Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn/maize (Ciba-Geigy), cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil (Calgene), Bt cotton (Monsanto), Bt potatoes (Monsanto), soybeans resistant to the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto), virus-resistant squash (Asgrow) and additional delayed ripening tomatoes (DNAP, Zeneca/Peto, and Monsanto) (Clive 2011). A total of 35 approvals had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop of carnations with 8 different traits in 6 countries plus the EU till 1996 (Clive 1996). As of 2011, the USA leads a list of multiple countries in the production of GM crops. Currently, there are a number of food species in which a genetically modified version exists (Johnson 2008). Some of the foods that are available in the market include cotton, soybean, canola, potatoes, eggplant, strawberries, corn, tomatoes, lettuce, cantaloupe, carrots etc. GM products which are currently in the pipeline include medicines and vaccines, foods and food ingredients, feeds and fibres. Locating genes for important traits, such as those conferring insect resistance or desired nutrients-is one of the most limiting steps in the process.

    <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>

    <p>In 2100, the consequences of climate change will probably fully realize. The Earth’s climate will be warmer, leading to more frequent and severe weather events. Rising sea levels, once a distant concern, will probably be a present and relentless threat, impacting millions of people living in coastal regions.

        Note: By current predictions, in worst scenario the global temperature could rise by 3.3 to 5.7ºC by 2100.
        Coastal cities like New York, Tokyo, Mumbai, Venice, Bangkok and many more might experience dramatic transformations. Different systems of sea walls, flood barriers, and advanced drainage infrastructure will be implemented to protect against sea level rise.
        
        Now, one must think about all these (in many cases catastrophic) predictions with a grain of salt. Because those are just predictions. Similar predictions 10 years ago stated that, for example, Miami and many other cities will be slightly underwater by year 2020 and as we know this didn’t happen.
        
        Additionally, we all know that ultra-rich people are constantly buying enormous houses and properties just few meters from seas and oceans.
        
        Well, one would think that if we’re expecting rather significant sea rises, that then mega-rich people (who are always planning for the future), wouldn’t buy such properties.
        
        For sure we’ll see what will happen with sea level rises by 2050 or even sooner and this will then give us more data to work with. Hopefully we will not witness catastrophic scenario because of human activities.
        
        And there will be more human activities and more resources needed because human population will grow.</p>
